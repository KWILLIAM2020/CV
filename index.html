  <p>I am Khun William and work for the International Committee of the Red Cross
    as a Human Resources Officer. I had been teaching English to adult students before
    I joined ICRC on the 11th of November 2017. I was selected from lots of candidates
    for the position of HR Officer in ICRC and it was my first job which was different
    from all my previous job and experience.</p>
  <p>My real dream job is not be merely an Human Resource Officer but to be a trainer
    educator who eagerly want to give a proper education to the poor and revolutionize
    the education system in Myanmar</p>
